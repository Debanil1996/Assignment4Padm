### DQN Model

This code defines a Deep Q-Network (DQN) class in Python using the PyTorch library for deep learning. Here's an explanation of the code:

The code starts with importing the necessary libraries. Since the provided code snippet doesn't include the import statements, it is assumed that they are already imported.

Qnet is a class derived from the nn.Module class, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. It represents the deep neural network architecture for the DQN.

The __init__ method initializes the Qnet class. It takes the number of possible actions (no_actions) and the number of states as input parameters.

Inside the __init__ method, three fully connected layers (self.fc1, self.fc2, and self.fc3) are defined using the nn.Linear class from PyTorch. These linear layers will be used for the forward pass of the network to process the input states and output the Q-values for each action.

The forward method overrides the forward pass behavior of the nn.Module class. It takes an input tensor x (observation/state) as input and performs the forward computation through the network. The input tensor passes through two Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation functions (F.relu) applied after the first two linear layers followed by the third linear layer without any activation. The resulting tensor is returned, representing the Q-values for each action.

The sample_action method is used to obtain an action based on the given observation and exploration parameter called epsilon.

Inside the sample_action method, first, the forward computation is done to get the Q-values for the given observation by calling self.forward(observation) and storing the result in a.

Then, the code checks whether to choose exploration or exploitation. If a random number between 0 and 1 is less than the given exploration rate epsilon, it means exploration should be conducted instead of exploitation. In this case, a random action index between 0 and 1 is selected and returned.

If the random number is greater than or equal to the exploration rate, it means exploitation should be performed. In this case, the action with the highest Q-value from tensor a is obtained by calling argmax() on a and converting it into a Python scalar value using item(). This index represents the selected action, which is returned by the function.

Overall, this code snippet defines a QNet class for a Deep Q-Network, with the ability to forward pass inputs to compute Q-values and sample actions based on exploration and exploitation strategies.


### Utils Python

This code snippet is for implementing the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm to train a neural network for reinforcement learning.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

Importing Libraries: The code starts by importing necessary libraries such as torch (PyTorch), random, deque from the collections module, and torch.nn.functional as F.

ReplayBuffer Class: The ReplayBuffer class is defined. It serves as a memory buffer to store and sample past experiences in order to break the temporal correlations of the input data. The constructor __init__ initializes an empty deque with a specified maximum length (buffer_limit). The put method appends a new transition (a tuple) to the buffer, and the sample method randomly selects n transitions from the buffer. The sampled transitions are then split into separate lists for states (s_lst), actions (a_lst), rewards (r_lst), next states (s_prime_lst), and done masks (done_mask_lst). The method size returns the current size of the buffer.

Train Function: The train function takes several arguments, including the networks (q_net and q_target), the replay buffer (memory), optimizer, batch size, and discount factor (gamma).

A loop runs 10 times to sample from the replay buffer. In each iteration:

The sample method of the replay buffer is called to retrieve a batch of transitions (s, a, r, s_prime, done_mask).

The Q-values are obtained for the current state s from the Q-network (q_out = q_net(s)).

The DQN update rule is applied to calculate the loss. First, the Q-values for the taken actions (a) are fetched using gather function (q_a = q_out.gather(1, a)). Then, the maximum Q-values for the next state s_prime are computed using the target Q-network (max_q_prime = q_target(s_prime).max(1)[0].unsqueeze(1)). Finally, the target Q-value (target) is calculated as the sum of the immediate reward (r) and the discounted future rewards (gamma * max_q_prime * done_mask). The loss is calculated using the smooth L1 loss (F.smooth_l1_loss(q_a, target)).

The optimizer's gradients are reset (optimizer.zero_grad()), the loss is backpropagated (loss.backward()), and the model parameters are updated based on the gradients (optimizer.step()).

The purpose of this code is to repeatedly sample batches from the replay buffer and update the Q-network using the DQN algorithm to improve its performance in a given reinforcement learning task.
